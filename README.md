# Pig-Game-Udemy

This game was built on Udemy's [**"The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!"**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-courseJavaScript) with Jonas Schmedtmann.

Roll a dice as a **player 1** and collect your score. Be careful, if you get _one_, your current score will zero out and the game will switch to the other player. So press "hold" to freeze your score.

Be the first one to reach 100!!!

[Have fun!](https://comforting-entremet-2d596c.netlify.app/)
